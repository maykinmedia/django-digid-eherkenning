Changelog
=========

0.9.0 (2023-10-23)
==================

Quality of life update

* [#45] Added automatic metadata retrieval

    * You can now configure a metadata source URL, which will download and process the
      metadata automatically.
    * Added a management command ``update_stored_metadata`` to refetch the metadata and
      process any updates.

* Added BSN validation to mock login form.

0.8.2 (2023-09-01)
==================

Nothing functional. Changed the verbose names of

* eHerkenning service *instance* UUID
* eIDAS service *instance* UUID


0.8.1 (2023-08-15)
==================

* Made EHerkenningConfiguration.loa required
  It was previously possible to accidentally misconfigure by selecting the
  empty option for the LOA in the admin.

  This patch contains a migration that will set undefined eHerkennning LOAs to
  low_plus. But if you have an invalid LOA set, the migration will fail with
  an IntegrityError. In case this happens, go to the admin and select a LOA.

==================

Feature release

* [#35] Confirmed support for Django 4.2

0.7.0 (2023-02-21)
==================

Quality of life updates

  envs anymore)
* [#25] Removed Django Choices usage in tests
* The post-binding form is now hidden from the end-user

0.6.0 (2023-02-16)

  the IDP metadata to prevent crashes

0.5.0 (2022-10-31)
==================

💥⚠️ Breaking changes ahead!

This release is an overhaul of the project configuration. We have moved away from
configuration via Django settings to configuration in the database. There is no
backwards compatible deprecation layer.

**Changes**

* Moved configuration of DigiD/eHerkenning/eIDAS to the admin. The ``DIGID`` and
  ``EHERKENNING`` settings no longer work.

  - in particular, the ``login_url`` key within these settings is not supported anymore,
    specify Django's ``LOGIN_URL`` setting instead or use the ``RelayState`` GET
    parameter
* Some default values have changed:

  - ``want_assertions_signed``: ``False`` -> ``True``
  - ``digestAlgorithm``: empty -> ``"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha1"``
* The DigiD ``session_age`` parameter used to be opt-in. This now defaults to 15 minutes
  (the maximum duration according to "DigiDCheck 2.2 T14 -- Sessieduur") through the
  ``DIGID_SESSION_AGE`` setting.
* Dropped support for Django 2.2 which is EOL
* Custom subclasses of ``digid_eherkenning.saml2.base.BaseSaml2Client`` need to implement
  the ``conf`` property - the ``__init__`` method no longer accepts a config dict.
* Metadata generation can now be done on the fly, in the browser. You'll find links on
  the admin configuration pages.
* Re-organized the documentation, which is now hosted on readthedocs.
* The package metadata now contains all the dependencies, including our python3-saml
  fork and extra's for local development
* Documented some security aspects that you need to get right when deploying your
  project.
* Refactored test setup to be more pytest oriented
* Code refactors
* Removed the base metadata generation methods and generic management command. The
  explicit commands and Saml2 client subclasses replace this (the original stuff was
  unused).
* Refactored management commands
* Added ``--save-config`` flag to management commands to support CLI-driven configuration
  and persisting that config to the database.

0.4.1 (2022-07-12)
==================

* Supported single logout:

  * Added Digid logout view for Sp-initiated logout
  * Added Didid callback view for Sp-initiated logout with HTTP-redirect binding
  * Added Digid callback view for Idp-initiated logout with SOAP binding
  * Generated metadata with two single logout endpoints

0.4.0 (2022-06-23)
==================

* Added ``slo`` required parameter for Digid metadata generation as a first step to support single logout.


0.3.3 (2022-06-15)
==================

* Update to include locale files for translations

0.3.2 (2022-06-14)
==================

* Updated DigiD error messages to comply with Logius specifications

0.3.1 (2022-04-21)
==================

* The content-type header used during the resolve artifact request was made configurable.

* Made Github the primary repository and Bitbucket a mirror
* Fixed Tox configuration
* Explicitly support Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9
* Explicitly support Django 2.2 and 3.2
* Set up Github workflows/actions for CI
